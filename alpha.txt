We've selected the top 50 Twitter accounts for following the latest US election news and political analysis, so you can keep up with all the controversy, surprises and polling throughout the campaign as they happen.

This is not meant to be a comprehensive list of the biggest or best known accounts. This is the Twitter accounts that we judge to be the most influential and smartest on all shades of the political spectrum, based on best use of Twitter through frequency, aggregation and interaction.

Did we miss out a brilliant Twitter account that should be on this list? Make your case in the comments below. You can read the whole list here, and you can subscribe to the whole list with a single click from your Twitter account. And you can always follow me on @RichardA for the Guardian's up to the minute coverage of US politics.
